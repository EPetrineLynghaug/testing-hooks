  - **Hooks** are functions or scripts triggered at specific points in the development workflow to automate repetitive tasks.
  - They help streamline processes such as building, testing, and deployment in development environments.
  - Instead of manually executing these tasks, hooks automate the process, saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors.
  - Common tools that provide hooks include **Git**, **npm**, and build systems like **Webpack**.

  - Hooks help ensure that critical tasks are performed consistently, reducing the chance of human error.
  - They allow for automatic checks, such as linting and testing, before code is committed or deployed.
  - Once set up, hooks can greatly enhance the efficiency of the development process by automating routine workflows.

  - **Initialize the Project**: Start by creating your project and initializing it using tools like npm or yarn.
  - **Install Development Dependencies**: Ensure all required dependencies for your development environment are installed.
  - **Set Up Basic API Structure**: Establish a foundational API structure for your project.
  - **Configure Linting and Prettier**: Set up linting and code formatting tools like ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality.
  - **Create Hook Scripts**: Implement custom scripts that trigger automatically during specific events in your workflow, such as pre-commit or pre-push.
  - **Test and Iterate**: After setting up, run your hooks to ensure they function as expected, refining them as needed.
